    <h1>Welcome to My Home Page</h1>

    <p>I've been into LEGO for years, but unfortunately fell out of it and just recently got back into it. I mainly collect Star Wars and Ninjago sets, and I'm always organizing or rebuilding stuff in my collection. I even collect random Lego lots to keep or sell them.</p>

    <h3>Coding and Tech</h3>

    <p>I'm studying ITM, so I spend a lot of time learning how to code and trying new tools. Projects like this help me practice hands-on application of them.</p>

    <h3>Fitness</h3>
